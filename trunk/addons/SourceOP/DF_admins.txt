// Admin file sample
// for SourceOP

// For a list of valid admin and player commands
// visit: http://www.sourceop.com/wiki/Commands

// To add a user, follow this format
// On a new line (with the quotes) put:
//   "SteamID:PLAYER_STEAM_ID"
//  or
//   "Name:PlayerName"
//  or
//   "IP:PlayerIP"
// Replace the information after the colon with the appropriate user data.
// Then on the line below add a '{' character.
// Then use the available commands on seperate lines below the '{' character:
//  baseLevel
//  password
//  denyCmd
//  denyAdminCmd
//  addAdminCmd
//  spawnLimit

// To deny a normal player command add:
//   denyCmd = command_to_deny
// To deny a admin command add:
//   denyAdminCmd = command_to_deny
// To add access to a admin command add:
//   addAdminCmd = command_to_add

// You can override the default spawn limit for the specific user by using "spawnLimit".
// For example, to set a spawnLimit of 40, add:
//   spawnLimit = 40
// The default value for spawnLimit is the value of the DF_spawnlimit_admin CVAR.

// Each command must be followed by a '=' character and then the information for the command.
// Then after all commands for the user have been set, add a '}' character on a seperate line.

// Examples for admins have been given below. Examples may and should be removed when editing this file.

// The default user is used for all players not authenticated as an admin.
// It's recommended that the default user has no access to admin commands.

// If no password is set, it is assumed that the user requires no password
// and the user matching the information will be authed without a password.

// All lines that have // before them are ignored by SourceOP when processing this file.


// This is an example user
// it is ignored since every line has // before it
//
// this user would have all commands that have level less
// than 128 and would not be allowed to use admin_pass.
// in addition, he or she would also have access to the
// admin_noclip and admin_rcon command.
// the user must login with password "exampleuser"
//"SteamID:STEAM_0:1:1234"
//{
//	baseLevel = 127
//	denyAdminCmd = pass
//	addAdminCmd = noclip
//	addAdminCmd = rcon
//	password = exampleuser
//}


// Another example user
// it is ignored since every line has // before it
//
// this entry causes all people named "Llama" to not
// be able to speak.
//"Name:Llama"
//{
//	baseLevel = 0
//	denyCmd = say
//	denyCmd = say_team
//}


// Last example user
// it is ignored since every line has // before it
//
// this entry causes the user with IP 10.32.4.18 to have access
// to all admin commands except slay (no password required)
//"IP:10.32.4.18"
//{
//	baseLevel = 131071
//	denyAdminCmd = slay
//}


// This is the default user.
// This should always remain in this file, but can be modified to your liking.
"Default:Default"
{
	baseLevel = 0
